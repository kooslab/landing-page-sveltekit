# Svelte Coding Standards

- Use Svelte 5 syntax with `onclick` instead of `on:click` directives
- Follow SvelteKit conventions for routing and API endpoints
- Use reactive declarations with the `$state`, `$derived`, and `$effect` runes
- Use snippets (`{#snippet}`) rather than slots when appropriate
- Ensure proper typing of components and functions
- Keep components focused and reusable
